            <p>The hardest part about a vacation is planning it. Where to go? Where are you going to sleep when you get there? What are you going to do while there? The thing is, vacations should be about relaxing and not having to worry about little details. Let us handle all the medan details of your vacation so you can spend every second with you freinds, family, or taking it easy by yourself!</p>

            <p>Budget Vacations is your one stop shop for all things dealing with vacations. We love to help anyone who wants to get away from everyday stessers. Budget Vacations started back in 1990 and have strived to provide the best planning, budgeting, and most exciting vactions possible. Although we love to assist anyone wanting to go on a vacation, we mostly help families get onto a very fun but yet affordable vacations. A lot of families go on vacations to popluar sites in the United States like Zion National Park in Utah or YellowStone in Wyomying.</p>

            <p>We offer three different packages for our planning services which you can take a look at <a href="packages.html">here</a>. All of these packages are great and will provide amazing memories for the whole family. They provide hotel stays, activities, and the higher packages offer date nights for the parents.</p>

    
        <h2 id="firststep">What are the first steps in planning your vacation?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick the destination</li>
                <li>Make a budget</li>
                <li>Decide on if you are driving or flying</li>
                <li>Figure out if you want to stay at a hotel or AirBnB</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Let's look a bit deeper at this list</h2>
            <p>Picking the place can be hard. Do you like the beach and ocean? Do you like woods and forests? Do you like sand dunes or mountains? Once you figure that out, it will be a little bit easier. Another <b>HUGE</b> question would be do you want to stay in the country you're in now or go out of the country?</p>

            <p>Budgeting is easy to plan, but hard to stick to. The budget needs to encompass the hotels/Air BnB place, the food, the activities, and souvenirs. That is the stuff that needs to be in the budget but then there are other things that should be in the budget that are unexpected expenses like extra clothes, hospital trips, medicines and other things.</p>

            <p>Deciding on whether to drive or fly to your dream vacation is an important decision. Driving could be fun with freinds or family because it allows quality time during the <strong>road trip</strong> however the drive time will have to be taken out the vacation time at your dream vacation location. Flying will allow you to get to your vacation destination sooner. That can be fun too! Getting to your destination sooner will help get you relaxed sooner and sometimes can be cheaper then driving.</p>
    
            <p>A hotel or AirBnB is a huge decision for many reasons. The hotels can be fun places to stay at espically if there is a pool. However the only meal they offer is breakfast and it is usually small amounts of food but all you can eat. Hotels can also get expensive if you have are on a long vacation. An AirBnB offers different options. They provide more privacy then hotels do and they usually come with a kitchen so you can buy groceries and cook your meals everyday which would save money because you wouldn't have to spend money on eating out for every meal other then breakfast. The AirBnB option also can be cheaper as they sometimes offer a disconted price for the longer someone stays at the AirBnB.</p>

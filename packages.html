                <p>How will you get around in Hawaii? You can't drive to Hawaii as awesome as that would be! There are plenty of options on how to get around there like public transportation, taxi's or renting a vehicle. We always recommend renting a vehicle because they offer packages and daily rates instead of per trip. Another reason we suggest renting a vehicle is privacy. You have way more privacy while renting a vehicle as opposed to taking public transportation. Below are some vehicle rental places.</p>
